Run a `npm install && start`

## assignments
1. --If you click on the `.root` div in the Amuse file the `getBalloons` action should be triggered so it will fetch new balloons--
2. --If there are 100 balloons or more remove all balloons--
3. --If there are 50 balloons change the position of all the balloons to a random position--
4. --On keydown move all balloons to a random position-- created a button for this just to keep it simple but this could also been done with an event listener
